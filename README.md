# Exercise-1---Person-Code
Code that changed my perspective of IT (Exercise 1 - Person Code)

## Code Explanation
This code gets a persons name, id, email and their address. This was the beginning material of Java where we learned to set variables and then get the information so that it can be displayed. For me this code changed my perspective of IT as I realized the differences that different programming languages can have but yet be similar in their fundamental roots.

My problem-solving approach was at this stage to know the fundementals and then to write the code, running the program, trying to understand why certain errors were shown and then fix them.
